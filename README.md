### How to use
If you want to use this useless page on your website, just download the html file and upload it to your webserver. You can also copy the code.
There is also an express webserver included. If you want to use it, make sure to download all files in the project folder and make sure, that node.js is installed.
If you want, you can change the server port at the top of index.js (default is 2225). When you're ready, navigate to the location where everything is stored and start the script (node index.js).

PS: This is one of my first "projects", so please don't expect too much!
